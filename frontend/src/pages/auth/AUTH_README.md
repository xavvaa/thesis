## Flow

1. User selects role (Jobseeker/Employer)
2. Based on selection, user is directed to appropriate auth component
3. For new users:
   - Fills out registration form
   - Accepts terms and conditions
   - (For employers) Uploads required documents
   - Receives email verification
4. For returning users:
   - Logs in with email/password or Google OAuth
   - Redirected to appropriate dashboard

## Security Notes
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- JWT tokens are used for session management
- All API calls use HTTPS
- Form inputs are validated both client and server side
